# U-Net for Mitochondria Segmentation

This project utilizes a U-Net architecture for the segmentation of mitochondria in electron microscopy (EM) data. I leverage PyTorch for building and training the model, along with various libraries like OpenCV for image processing and visualization. The model is trained on a custom dataset of mitochondrial images, with binary masks as ground truth. 

In this project I have used deep learning, image processing, and PyTorch to achieve accurate segmentation results for biological image data.
